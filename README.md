## This repository will contain all the code for the paper on the fitting package.

To access the documentation you need to go to /doc and open documentation.html or documentation_windows.html. 
This is temporary, in the future the documentation will be hosted in readthedocs.

Note that not all example notebooks are updated to match the documentation yet.

Notes 21/3/2017:
 - removed the argument dataPath from the configure fit functions arguments.
 - dataFileName variable added to customize the name of the data file.
 - fitLabel variable added to customize the name of the fit results file.
 - path for pso and lma results no longer in the pso/lma parameters file, now passed directly through the python call
 - paths with spaces issue fixed

Only the example notebooks GAPD and GAPD_parameter_scan are updated.

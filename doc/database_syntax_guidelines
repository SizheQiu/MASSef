General guidelines for the format of the database file.

Column 1: 
 - enzyme names, only on the first row of the data.

Column 2: 
 - field description, on all rows, e.g. if there are 2 Km values for one enzyme, both rows have "km" on column 2.
 - mandatory first 6 fields for all enzymes (in order): ec_number, reaction, mechanism, structure, active_sites, allosteric_sites
 - remaining fields should be data entries, thus possible descriptions are: Km, kcat, s05, inhib, act, other
          

Co-substrates entry formatting: metabolite1,concentration1;metabolite2,concentration2
Buffer entry formatting: buffer1,concentration1;buffer2,concentration2
Salts entry formatting: salt1,concentration1; salt2,concentration2

No white spaces in data fields (Km, kcat, s05, Ki,...)

Last line columns must be filled with end "End".

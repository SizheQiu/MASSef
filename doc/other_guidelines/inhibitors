We consider 4 types of inhibition
 - competitive, where the inhibitor affects the enzyme form to which the affected metabolite binds
 - uncompetitive, where the inhibitor affects the complex of the enzyme and the affected metabolite
 - mixed, where the inhibitor affects both the enzyme form to which the affected metabolite bind and the complex of the enzyme and the affected metabolite
 	- noncompetitive, a special case of mixed inhibition, where Kii = Kis
 - allosteric


the inhibition type is more important to simulate the data properly than to add the reactions - those may actually have to be added by hand

inhibition constants naming rules:
Kic - competitive inhib
Kiu - uncompetitive inhib
Kincc - noncompetitive inhib, competitive part
Kincu - noncompetitive inhib, uncompetitive part
